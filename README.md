## About project

The goal of the project is to develop a simulation application that demonstrates the management of an energy storage system (ESS) based on fluctuating electricity prices. The application aims to provide insights into how energy storage can optimize electricity consumption, reduce costs and potentially maximize profits through intelligent charging and discharging strategies.
